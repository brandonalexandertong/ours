        <p class=""> At Ours, we realize that the American is under threat of extinction. We aim to use the resources we have—our business, our voice, jackets, water bottles and yoga mats — to do something about it.
        </p>
        <p>Ours grew out of a small garage that made non-lethal military defense weapons. Although we eventually upgraded from that garage, defense remains at the heart of our business. We take localism very seriously— and we’re happy to share our “Locals Only” attitude of defense technology with outdoor lifestyles. . For us, Americans utilizing their right to the outdoors for skiing, snowboarding, surfing, fly fishing, mountain biking are essential to preserving that connection against foreign destruction.
        </p>
        <p> As we approach climate fallout, we see a potential- even probable end to the American outdoors. For us, this issue comes first, profit second. We donate time, aid and 80% of our annual sales to the protection and defense of the homeland. This means donating to organizations that are dedicated to building a stronger America: from private border defense groups, organic farms, radical lobbyists, recycling programs, to starting our own program: the Malthusian Initiative. We know the risk saving a tree only to lose the forest—a livable planet. As the loss of biodiverse landscapes all accelerate, we are doing our best to address the cause, and not just symptoms, of global warming: overpopulation.
        </p>
        <p> Ours is based on the idea that we do the work for you. As the experts say: leave it to the experts. We know exactly what needs to be done to preserve this way of life; so leave it to us, you supporting us is doing your part. We like to think of activism being built into our products—not something you have to do outside of them; some see it as a “do good tax” that we incorporate into our products. Don’t worry, we’ve got this.
